We analyse the deep neural netwrok (DNN): https://becominghuman.ai/simple-neural-network-on-mnist-handwritten-digit-dataset-61e47702ed25,
which is a simple DNN to classify the MNIST dataset: https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/mnist

a (vekt 5%)
What is the size of input image?
The MNIST datasets consists of input images of 28 by 28 pixels, which show grayscale images of handwritten digits.
The size of the input image of 28x28pixels results in 784 (28x28) input neurons in the DNN input layer.

b (vekt 5%)
What does the output layer represent?
The output layer of the DNN represents the predicted class or label for the input image.
As we have ten different digits included in the MNIST dataset, ranging from 0 to 9, the output layer consists of
10 neurons, where each neuron represents one of the possible classes or labels.

A DNN consists of the input layer, hidden layer(s) and the output layer. The DNN assigns probability values to
different neurons in its hidden layers, and the final prediction of which digit the input image represented in the 
output layer is based on which output neuron has the highest probability.

c (vekt 5%)
How many layers does the DNN have? What are these layers?
The DNN has
1. The input layer. This layer represents the input data, consisting of 28x28pixel input images.
2.  Hidden layer, consisting of 5 neurons.
3. The output layer, made up of 10 neurons. Each of these neurons corresponds to one of the possible classes,
which are the digits 0 to 9.

d (vekt 5%)
Which are the functions connecting two layers? What is the loss function?
These layers are connected by weights and biases associated with the neurons. 

e (vekt 5%)
How many parameters does the DNN have?
To calculate the number of parameters of this DNN, we consider the weights and biases of all layers. In the given
example, the input layer has 784 neurons, connected with the hidden layer of 128 neurons, and 128 biases, one for
each neuron. Additionally, the output layer has 10 neurons, one per digit.
The total number of parameters is:
